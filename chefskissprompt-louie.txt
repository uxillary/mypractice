You are building a production-ready Astro + React + Tailwind website for a luxury bridal makeup artist named “Louie Graham”. 
Goal: ship a fast, image-led brochure site, deployable to Cloudflare Pages, with a CF Worker handling form submissions.

### Tech:
- Astro latest with React integration, TailwindCSS, @astrojs/image, @astrojs/sitemap.
- Astro Content Collections for: pages, services, testimonials, portfolio items.
- Cloudflare adapter for Astro. One Cloudflare Worker in /functions for POST /api/contact.

### Project bootstrap:
1) Create a new Astro project with Tailwind and React.
2) Configure `astro.config.mjs` for Cloudflare Pages adapter and image integration.
3) Add a `content/` folder with collections:
   - `pages` (mdx): home, about, services, experience, testimonials, contact, faq.
   - `services` (md): slug, title, summary, duration, includes[], optionalPrice.
   - `portfolio` (md): title, categories[], coverImage, gallery[].
   - `testimonials` (md): name, quote, eventLocation, date.
4) Add a CF Worker at `/functions/api/contact.ts` that:
   - Validates fields (name, email, date, location, message, services[]).
   - Rate-limits by IP (KV).
   - Sends an email via MailChannels (or logs to console in dev).
   - Returns JSON {ok:true} or {ok:false,error}.

### Pages & components:
- Layouts: `BaseLayout.astro` (SEO, JSON-LD helpers), `PageHeader.astro` (eyebrow, h1, intro).
- Components:
  - `Hero.astro` (image-left variant, CTA buttons "Check availability", "View services").
  - `ValueTiles.astro` (3 tiles, minimal icons).
  - `ServiceCards.astro` (maps content/services).
  - `ExperienceSteps.astro` (numbered timeline with sticky sidebar CTA).
  - `MasonryGallery.tsx` (CSS columns; lightbox modal).
  - `TestimonialSlider.tsx` (progress dots, autoplay).
  - `ContactForm.tsx` (client-side validation, fetch to /api/contact, success/fail states, no popups).
  - `LogoWall.astro` (optional “Featured In”).
  - `InstagramStrip.tsx` (SSR-safe placeholder grid + link out).
- Styles: Tailwind preset for luxury look (letter-spacing on headings, generous leading, muted palette).
- Fonts: Heading serif (e.g., “Playfair Display” or “Cormeor”), body sans (e.g., “Inter”).
- Colors: sand `#efe9e4`, ivory `#f8f6f3`, charcoal `#222`, soft gold accent `#c8b58b`, on-hover underlines.

### Content seed (from client brochure):
Use these as initial markdown entries.

About (pages/about.mdx):
- Pull “With over five years… Regional Makeup Artist for Chanel within Edinburgh… calm, professional… timeless, elegant looks.”
- Tone: confident, warm, editorial.

Services (content/services/*.md):
- Bridal Trial: summary from brochure; 1.5–2 hours; purpose = explore & perfect the look.
- Wedding Day – Bride: bespoke, long-lasting, photo-ready; premium products.
- Bridal Party: bridesmaids/mothers; harmonised with bridal aesthetic.
- Full-Day Service (Optional): touch-ups or second look for evening.
- Destination Weddings: UK + international; travel & accommodation covered by client; coordinated planning.

Bridal Experience (pages/experience.mdx):
- 5 steps: Initial Enquiry & Booking; The Trial; Wedding Morning; Bridal Party; Optional Extras (full-day service, touch-up kit, travel).
- Add sticky CTA “Check availability” linking to /contact.

Contact (pages/contact.mdx):
- Email: bridal@louiedoesmakeup.com
- Form fields: name, email, date, venue/location, party size, services interested in, message.

Home (pages/index.mdx):
- Hero with headline: “Timeless, camera-ready bridal makeup.”
- Subhead: “Editorial polish, calm morning energy.”
- Tiles linking to Services / Portfolio / Experience.
- LogoWall placeholder (future press/brand).

Portfolio:
- Create 6 sample items with placeholder images and categories [Bridal, Occasion, Fashion].

Testimonials:
- Create a page that reads the collection and displays 3–6 quotes (seed with short placeholders).

### UX details:
- Reduce cognitive load—copy length like dawnartists.com sections, clean blocks, strong whitespace.
- Buttons: pill shape, subtle border, no heavy fills; underline-on-hover links.
- Image handling: preload hero; lazy-load gallery; focus-visible states.
- Motion: tiny fade/slide on tiles and galleries; prefers-reduced-motion respected.

### SEO & Schema:
- Add JSON-LD: Person (Louie Graham), Service (MakeupApplication), LocalBusiness where relevant.
- Meta defaults; OG images generated per page.
- robots.txt + sitemap.xml.

### Build scripts:
- `dev`, `build`, `preview`, `cf:pages` (wrangler config for local test).

### Deliverables:
- A runnable project with all pages, seeded content, and CF Worker mock that logs form submissions.
- Include clear README: Cloudflare Pages deploy, environment vars for Worker (KV binding, MailChannels).
- Keep components small, accessible, and visually consistent.

Now generate the complete project structure and example files with realistic placeholder images and markdown content per above.
