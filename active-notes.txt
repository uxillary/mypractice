📅 Ready to Go on November 10th, after final worming and first vaccination.

All puppy records will be provided with detailed information of their routine etc., a bag of their food and a blanket for famimliarity to encourage a peaceful transition.

These puppies are not just healthy; they're also well-conditioned and full of life. They've been raised with love and care, and their excellent nature shines through.

Both parents are at home and available to meet. You can see where these wonderful pups get their great personalities! The Dam boasts a beautiful Blue Roan coat, while the Sire sports a sunny Lemon Roan coat.
