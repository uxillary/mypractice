📅 Ready to rehome now, they've had their final vet check-up, final worming and first vaccination.

These puppies are healthy; they're also well-conditioned and full of life. They've been raised with love and care, and their excellent nature shines through.

🚽 Good progress with toilet training, going very well at the moment - trained to go in the garden!

Both parents are at home and available to meet. You can see where these pups get their great personalities! The Dam boasts a beautiful Blue Roan coat, while the Sire sports a sunny Lemon Roan coat.
