We have Cocker Spaniels (worker) puppies - 2 ♀️Females left! 1 Black and white (Blue Roan) & 1 Brown and White (Chocolate Roan)

Our puppies are:

✅ Wormed: They've received regular deworming to ensure their health.
✅ Vaccinated: They have been given their first vaccination today to keep them happy and healthy.
✅ Microchipped: Each puppy is be microchipped for added security.

📅 Ready to rehome now, they've had their final vet check-up, final worming and first vaccination.

These puppies are healthy; they're also well-conditioned and full of life. They've been raised with love and care, and their excellent nature shines through.

🚽 Good progress with toilet training, going very well at the moment - trained to go in the garden!

Both parents are at home and available to meet. You can see where these pups get their great personalities! The Dam boasts a beautiful Blue Roan coat, while the Sire sports a sunny Lemon Roan coat.

All puppy records will be provided with detailed information of their routine etc., a bag of their food and a blanket for familiarity to encourage a peaceful transition.
