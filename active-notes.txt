Cocker Spaniel Puppies Ready for Their New Homes Now - Vaccinated & Chipped!

--------------------

We have 3/7 Cocker Spaniels (worker) puppies - 1 ♂️Male, 2 ♀️Females left!

Our puppies are:

✅ Wormed: They've received regular deworming to ensure their health.

✅ Vaccinated: They have been given their first vaccination today to keep them happy and healthy.

✅ Microchipped: Each puppy is be microchipped for added security.

📅 Ready to rehome now, they have had their final vet check-up, final worming and first vaccination.

All puppy records will be provided with detailed information of their routine etc., a bag of their food and a blanket for familiarity to encourage a peaceful transition.

These puppies are not just healthy; they're also well-conditioned and full of life. They've been raised with love and care, and their excellent nature shines through.

Both parents are at home and available to meet. You can see where these pups get their great personalities! The Dam boasts a beautiful Blue Roan coat, while the Sire sports a sunny Lemon Roan coat.

Feel free to ask us any queries you may have and additional photo requests.
