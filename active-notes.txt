📅 Ready to rehome now, they have had their final vet check-up, final worming and first vaccination.

These puppies are healthy; they're also well-conditioned and full of life. They've been raised with love and care, and their excellent nature shines through.

Both parents are at home and available to meet. You can see where these pups get their great personalities! The Dam boasts a beautiful Blue Roan coat, while the Sire sports a sunny Lemon Roan coat.
