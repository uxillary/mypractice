🔨 1. Local File Awareness (repo mode)
Let the assistant:

✅ Read from selected files or directories
✅ Display a list of functions/classes to analyze or refactor
✅ Offer dropdowns or checkboxes to “include files in prompt”

💡 How: Use os.walk() to index the repo, preview contents, allow selection, then stitch those into your prompt intelligently.

📦 2. Smart PR + Git Integration
Codex can:
Generate commit messages (✅ already doing this!)
- Next: Add buttons to:
git add .
Generate + run git commit -m "..." from prompt
git push (optionally)
Generate full pull request description
💡 Optional: Call gh CLI commands from Python to create PRs programmatically.

📂 3. Multi-File Suggestion Mode
Use a textarea or panel that displays multiple generated file contents. Then:

Copy to clipboard
Save each file locally
Add them directly to a temp repo

Think: “create a new config.py, main.py, and utils.py from this description” → show all 3 with save buttons.

🧠 4. Persistent File Summary Cache
The web Codex does "context fetching" — you can replicate that locally by:
Creating a summary of every file (via GPT)
Caching those summaries
Feeding summaries + filenames instead of full files when context is tight

📈 5. Cost Tracking per Session / Repo
You're already estimating cost/token use. Next:
Add session-level totals
Let users see: “This repo session cost you $0.13 and 1,200 tokens”

🧪 6. Superpower: Plugin Mode or Tool Menu
Offer these menu items:

✅ Explain this repo
✅ Show dependencies
✅ Create a README.md
✅ Auto-generate unit tests
✅ Convert to another language (Python → JS)
✅ Create .env.example or .dockerfile

These are all things web Codex can do, but you’ll make them one-click and local.

🧠 7. Advantage You’ll Have
Offline or minimal browser dependency
More control over flow and customization
Better token transparency
Expandable, personal, open-source
Tailored to your dev style — not just GitHub’s
