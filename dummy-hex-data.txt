What WinOLS Can Do (That You Can’t — Yet)
Feature	WinOLS Style	Do You Have It Yet?	Priority
1. Live Hex-to-Map Linking	Select region → define as table/map	❌ Manual only via extractor	🔥
2. Automated Axis Detection	Guesses axes based on patterns/lookup	❌ Not yet	🔥 
3. Checksum Auto-Fix in-place	Patches checksums back into file	❌ External tool only	🔥 
4. Driver (.ols/.kp) Definitions	Pre-labeled maps with units/scaling	❌ Not yet	🔥 
5. 3D Map View with Live Edit	Real-time 3D graph editing of map values	❌ Only 2D tables now	🔥 
6. Map Search/Filter Across ECU	Search for maps by name or shape	❌ No global map list yet	🔥 
7. Real-Time Checksum Monitoring	See checksum status per region	❌ Manual only	✅ 
8. Scripted Batch Changes	“Increase all fuel at RPM>3000 by 5%”	❌ Not implemented	🧠 Stretch goal
9. Visual DTC Toggle Interface	Turn off error codes (e.g., P0420)	❌ Simulator only	✅ 
10. Map Smoothing Tools	Linear/spline interpolation	❌ Not available yet	✅

🧪 What You Can Do Better Than WinOLS
Feature	Your Version	Why It’s Better
Beginner UX	Interactive, visual	Much easier to use than raw hex
Cross-tool flow	Modular → connected	Cleaner than one bloated app
Web-based	No install required	Works on anything, no dongles
Simulation	Real-time remap visual	WinOLS doesn’t simulate

🔮 What You Need to Build Next (Not Just One Tool)
Instead of building another standalone tool, think in terms of features and flows that make your system competitive:

🔧 Suggested Next Feature Set
1. Map Definition + Anchor Tool (Map Definer)
Select bytes in Binary Editor
Define name, axis, unit, scale
Save as reusable map
Visually label maps in context

✅ This replaces both .kp and “define map” actions

2. Hex-to-Table Linking (Overlay)
Overlay table/grid on top of binary view
Click → auto structure and preview in-place
Use pattern detection as assist

✅ Replicates how WinOLS auto-creates maps from hex

3. Inline Checksum Watcher
Automatically detect known checksum regions
Live validation badge per map
Button: “Auto-fix and export”

4. Batch Edit Scripting
Input: if rpm > 3000 then value *= 1.05
Run on table or hex region
Preview diff before saving
